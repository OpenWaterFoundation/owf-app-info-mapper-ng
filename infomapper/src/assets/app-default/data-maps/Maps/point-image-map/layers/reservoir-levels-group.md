# Reservoir Levels #

This markdown file would contain information about the Reservoir Level layer group on this map
(a group of layers). This is just placeholder text to show what an Information (or Doc) Dialog
would look like in a production setting. Along with markdown files, raw HTML and regular text
files are also supported for documentation. Images can also be displayed.
