# Default Application Configuration #

The [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](https://openwaterfoundation.org) is a nonprofit social enterprise that is working to provide
an open source software platform to help organizations make better decisions about water.

The InfoMapper software is a web application that displays text content pages, maps, data visualizations, and other content.
This is the default application for the InfoMapper, a minimal configuration displaying a skeleton set up of the site. If
this is being displayed, a user-created `app-config.json` file needs to be created in order to override this default app. If
the `app-config.json` file has been created, confirm the path to the file is correct. Documentation and troubleshooting can be
found at the [InfoMapper User Documentation](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/infomapper/latest/doc-user/).
