# InfoMapper Default Application Configuration #

If you are seeing this page, the InfoMapper software has

1. not been configured for a specific application, or
2. encountered an application configuration error

The InfoMapper software is developed by the [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](https://openwaterfoundation.org),
which is is a nonprofit social enterprise that develops open source software and open data solutions
to help make better decisions about water.
The InfoMapper software is a web application that displays text content pages, maps, data visualizations, and other content.

This is the default minimal configuration for the InfoMapper.
To configure an InfoMapper application, an `app-config.json` file needs to be created to override this default configuration.
If the `app-config.json` file has been created, confirm the path to the file is correct.
Documentation and troubleshooting can be
found at the [InfoMapper User Documentation](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/infomapper/latest/doc-user/).
