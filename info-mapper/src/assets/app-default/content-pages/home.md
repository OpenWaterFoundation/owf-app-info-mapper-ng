# Poudre Basin Information Portal (Prototype default) #
The [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](openwaterfoundation.org) is in the process of developing this website to provide access to cross-jurisdictional datasets for the Poudre Basin, to understand Poudre Basin water resources issues for different temporal and spatial extents that support decision-making.

The same topic (e.g., streamflow) may be represented in multiple menus and maps, each with a different perspective. Standard visualization tools such as maps and graphs are being implemented to provide simple access to data and information. The website design leans toward simple maps, each with a few related layers, rather than a single map with many layers.

Use the navigation bar at the top to select maps, visualizations, and other products.
