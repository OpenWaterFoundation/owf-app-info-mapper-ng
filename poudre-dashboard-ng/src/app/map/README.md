# Map Component

The Map Page is composed of a leaflet map and dynamic sliding sidebar.  It is still under development, and currently displays a single map based on JSON configuration data saved in the assets/leaflet/data-files folder. The map data itself is stored in the map-files folder.

## Sidebar

The sidebar is based on an adapted version of the Turbo87 leaflet-sidebar, available on Github at [https://github.com/Turbo87/leaflet-sidebar](https://github.com/Turbo87/leaflet-sidebar).  The relevant code is saved in the assets/leaflet-sidebar folder.  This sidebar has the advantage of a retracting options to provide a cleaner interface and is mobile-friendly.

Moving forward, the sidebar should allow a user to toggle individual map data layers and settings.
