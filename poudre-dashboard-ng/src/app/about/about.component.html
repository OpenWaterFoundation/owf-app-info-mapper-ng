    The Poudre Basin Information Portal project provides access to cross-jurisdictional datasets and visualizations for the Poudre Basin,
    integrating datasets from various entities in the basin and providing links to additional datasets and resources.

    residents and decision-makers in the basin can better understand the sometimes complex relationships between water-related topics.
