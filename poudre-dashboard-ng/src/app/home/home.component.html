  <h1>Poudre Basin Information Portal (prototype)</h1>
  <p>
  The <a href="http://openwaterfoundation.org" target="_blank">Open Water Foundation (OWF)</a>
    is in the process of developing this website
    to provide access to cross-jurisdictional datasets for the Poudre Basin,
    to understand Poudre Basin water resources issues for different temporal and spatial extents that
    support decision-making.
  </p>
  <p>
    The same topic (e.g., streamflow) may be represented in multiple menus and maps,
    each with a different perspective.
    Standard visualization tools such as maps and graphs are being implemented
    to provide simple access to data and information.
    The website design leans toward simple maps, each with a few related layers,
    rather than a single map with many layers.
